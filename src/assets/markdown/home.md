<SectionHR>Welcome</SectionHR>

Hello, and welcome to my site. I'm Tim Finley, a Broadcast Engineer with a strong background in FM broadcasting.
While my primary focus is broadcast engineering, I also have interests in IT and computer repair. If you're having an issue and would like me to help troubleshoot, please open a ticket at my [tech support website](https://fgtech.finley-group.com).

In addition, I've also been learning various programming languages. I have worked on several projects in Python, VueJS, and Javascript. Recently, I have started learning Rust.  

This webpage was a practice in VueJS as well as SCSS. Everything here was developed by me, with inspiration from [Jim Robertus](https://thelcars.com/). Some of the buttons along the side have functions. Most are just placeholders. There is also a hidden audio player that you can use to stream some of the stations I oversee. You can see the source of this website on my [github](https://github.com/maxtimbo/finley-group-lcars).

In addition to coding, I am also an FAA Part 107 Licensed Pilot and have done several drone missions around both radio broadcast towers and private homes for real estate agents. For inquiries regarding drone missions, please send me an [email](mailto:tim.finley24@gmail.com). Some samples of my work are below.
